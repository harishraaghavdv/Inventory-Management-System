# Inventory-Management-System
A simple yet powerful Inventory Management System built with Python that stores data in an Excel file using `pandas` and `openpyxl`. This system lets users manage products in a store with options to add, update, delete, search, and generate inventory reports â€” all via a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
