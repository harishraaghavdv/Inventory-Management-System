#  Inventory Management System - Python Task 

A simple yet powerful Inventory Management System built with **Python** that stores data in an **Excel file** using `pandas` and `openpyxl`. This system lets users manage products in a store with options to add, update, delete, search, and generate inventory reports â€” all via a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.
